# Data Models - Player and Match Structs

Implement the core data models used throughout the matchmaker service.

## Sub-tasks:

- [x] **Implement Player model** (`internal/models/player.go`):
  - `ID` (string): Unique player identifier
  - `Name` (string): Player display name
  - `Role` (string): Either "survivor" or "killer"
  - `TicketID` (string): Unique ticket for queue tracking
  - Add JSON struct tags for API serialization

- [x] **Implement Match model** (`internal/models/match.go`):
  - `ID` (string): Unique match identifier
  - `Survivors` ([]Player): Array of 4 survivor players
  - `Killer` (Player): Single killer player
  - `CreatedAt` (time.Time): Timestamp of match creation
  - Add JSON struct tags for API serialization

- [x] **Create PlayerInfo struct** for API responses:
  - `ID` (string)
  - `Name` (string)
  - Used in match status response to avoid exposing internal fields

- [x] **Create role constants**: Define constants for "survivor" and "killer" roles to avoid magic strings

- [x] **Add validation helper**: Create function to validate role is either "survivor" or "killer"
