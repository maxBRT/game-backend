# Create Domain Models

Define the Entity Framework Core models for Player, Item, and Inventory as specified in the feature spec.

## Sub-tasks:

- [x] **Create Player model**: Create `Models/Player.cs` with properties: `Id` (string), `Username` (string), `Level` (int), `Xp` (int), `Currency` (int)
- [x] **Create Item model**: Create `Models/Item.cs` with properties: `Id` (string), `Name` (string), `Price` (int for currency cost)
- [x] **Create Inventory model**: Create `Models/Inventory.cs` as a join entity linking Player to Item with `Quantity` property
- [x] **Configure relationships**: Set up navigation properties and configure relationships in `AppDbContext` (Player has many Inventory entries, Item can be in many Inventories)
- [ ] **Create initial migration**: Run `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate` to generate the database schema
